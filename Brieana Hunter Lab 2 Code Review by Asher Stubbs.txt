Brieana Hunter Lab 2 Code Review
By Asher Stubbs
The GUI for this lab was well laid out and easy to navigate, I particularly liked the dropdown sort, that is something I used in my lab also. The population stats being displayed along the bottom and still being able to be hidden when desired was neat, I enjoyed that. The GUI did seem to be a bit too compact though, it just seems a bit crowded and claustrophobic, the data table has to be manually scrolled to see all the columns and there are only ever five rows visible at a time. I believe adding code for the save button to update the population stats would be a good idea as well, they only update if the button for that stat is refreshed so adding records doesn't update the stat in real time. The form window does not open center screen and the exit button is nonfunctional, it seems somehow the event got removed from the button. In my opinion it would be good practice to round/truncate the displayed average population. The code is missing comments but is easily understandable, there is some dead code with the btnClear event. It is interesting to me that the total variable is int but highest and lowest are both double, no real downside but for consistency sticking with one variable type might be preferred. No exception handling is present so crashes are possible if the table methods return null values or if record adding/editing is done incorrectly. Overall the lab is functional and satisfies the core requirements, I believe it just needs some further refinements to take the GUI and code to the next level.
