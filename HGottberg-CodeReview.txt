Heinrich Gottberg Code Review of Brieana Hunter Lab 2

Is the code generally readable and well-documented?

	The code is legible, but there weren't any comments so it was a little harder
	to find everything as fast. Comments on the lambda expressions would be nice 
	too.

Did you find any software defects?

	No defects as far as I can tell, everything ran without issue.

What was one way that their solution differed from yours?

	The buttons functioned with hidden labels while I did message boxes.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

	I think adding comments will go a long way with documenting your code. 
	Also the buttons and label colors were clashing a tiny bit so maybe adjust
	those later. :)	

Good job completing the assignment, everything works and the data is presentable.
